* **Objective** - to create an implementation of a web service
* **Purpose** - to demonstrate the construction of a full-stacked web-application
* **Description**
	* This Case Study is your first foray into building a full-stack application. You'll be building a Spring MVC based application, which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.
	* This is exciting! It's a lot, but we've given you the tools to be able to build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. You also get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!
	* You will be working individually to design your app. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into coding! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals.
